# Manipulator Robot Simulation for Pick and Place Task

## Overview
This repository contains a MATLAB script to simulate the trajectory generation, modeling, and control of a 3-degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator robot for a simple pick and place task. The script includes:

- **Trajectory Generation:** Generates a smooth Cartesian trajectory between a pick and a place position.
- **Robot Modeling:** Implements forward and inverse kinematics for the manipulator.
- **Control System:** Utilizes a PID controller to follow the desired trajectory.
- **Visualization:** Plots the end-effector trajectory, joint angles, and joint velocities over time.

## Features
- Customizable parameters for link lengths, joint limits, and trajectory settings.
- Basic forward and inverse kinematics for a planar robot.
- PID control to maintain the trajectory.
- Graphical visualization of results.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (tested on R2021b and newer versions).

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `manipulator_simulation.m` file in MATLAB.
3. Modify the parameters, such as link lengths and pick/place positions, to suit your requirements.
4. Run the script.
5. Observe the results in the generated plots:
   - **End-effector trajectory in 3D space.**
   - **Joint angles over time.**
   - **Joint velocities over time.**
5. Tune your PID
   and loop

## Customization
- Update the `link_lengths` and `joint_limits` variables to match your robot's configuration.
- Modify the `pick_position` and `place_position` variables to change the task specifics.
- Adjust the PID control gains (`kp`, `ki`, `kd`) to tune the controller.

## Limitations
- The inverse kinematics function provided is a simplified placeholder and may need to be replaced or extended for different robot configurations.
- The simulation assumes planar motion and does not include advanced dynamics.

## Future Improvements
- Extend to 3D kinematics and dynamics for non-planar robots.
- Add collision detection and avoidance.
- Implement advanced control methods like Model Predictive Control (MPC).
